## 🔄 Automatic Deployments

### Vercel - Auto Deploys on GitHub Push
```
Every time you push to main branch:
1. GitHub webhook triggers Vercel
2. Vercel pulls latest code
3. Runs build command
4. Deploys automatically (2-3 mins)

No manual action needed!
```

### Railway/Render - Auto Deploys on GitHub Push
```
Similarly, backend auto-deploys:
1. GitHub webhook triggers Railway/Render
2. Latest code pulled
3. Dependencies installed
4. API restarts (5-10 mins)

Enable in settings → Auto Deploy: ON
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Deployments

### Frontend (Vercel) Not Working

**Issue: Build fails**
```
Solution:
1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure NODE_ENV is not set to production locally
3. Verify package.json has all dependencies
4. Run npm install locally to verify
```

**Issue: Blank page or 404 errors**
```
Solution:
1. Check console (F12) for errors
2. Verify REACT_APP_API_URL environment variable
3. Check if backend API is accessible from frontend
4. CORS might be blocking - contact backend admin
```

**Issue: Real-time updates not working**
```
Solution:
1. WebSocket (ws://) not upgrading to WSS (wss://)
2. Check browser console for WebSocket errors
3. Vercel may need special WebSocket configuration
4. Use polling as fallback in development
```

### Backend (Railway/Render) Not Working

**Issue: Service times out during startup**
```
Solution:
1. Check if dependencies install is taking too long
2. Reduce package.json size (remove dev dependencies)
3. Use wheel files for faster installation
4. Contact Railway/Render support
```

**Issue: Database connection failed**
```
Solution:
1. Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable
2. Check if database service is running
3. Test locally: psql $DATABASE_URL
4. May need to provision database separately
```

**Issue: API returns 502 Bad Gateway**
```
Solution:
1. Check Railway/Render logs for errors
2. Verify start command is correct
3. Ensure port is set to $PORT variable
4. Check if dependencies are installed
```
